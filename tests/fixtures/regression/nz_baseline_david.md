  - Transition logistics: After breakfast, depart Te Anau early for the scenic drive to Milford Sound.
  - This is a coordination point where people need to be together.
  - Notes: Typical Te Anau → Milford Sound drive time is around 2 hours in good conditions.

Guidance is to allow 45–60 minutes total to park and walk from the main car park, and to check in at the Milford Sound Visitor Terminal at least 20 minutes before departure; the 10:00 time here represents a plausible mid-morning sailing.
  - Plan to wrap this up by 12:15 so you're ready for Lunch – Discover Milford Sound Information Centre & Cafe, Milford Sound (DD + AS).
